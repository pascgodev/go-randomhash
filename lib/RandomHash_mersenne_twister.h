 * The Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)
 *
 * This is an implementation of fast PRNG called MT19937, meaning it has a
 * period of 2^19937-1, which is a Mersenne prime.
 *
 * This PRNG is fast and suitable for non-cryptographic code.  For instance, it
 * would be perfect for Monte Carlo simulations, etc.
 *
 * For all the details on this algorithm, see the original paper:
